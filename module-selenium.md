# Selenium

Selenium module can be used in dynamic page web scraping on Windows Systems. It supports Firefox, IE, Chrome and Remote.

## Basic steps

### Step 1 install selenium

pip install selenium

### Step 2 install webdriver and put it in the project's working directory

For example, I use Chrome, so I need download a ChromeDriver. Download linkï¼š
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home

### Step 3 start from opening a dynamic page web url

```python
browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get('http://money.cnn.com/search/index.html?sortBy=date&primaryType=mixed&search=Search&query=trade%20war')
time.sleep(10)
```

For detailed use, refer to the Selenium documentation:

## Chrome driver not found in path error

This is common error. You can download [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home) and put it in your [Current Working Folder](shell.md#verify-your-current-working-folder). Note, for venv and jupyter user, this is not your project root folder, or the venv folder. It is the path at which you issued the `jupyter notebook` command -- a.k.a. "current working folder".

MAC user has a shortcut to install chromedriver in the path.

```shell
brew cask install chromedriver
```

## Find elements by Xpath

For `XPath` method, XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document. The following are basic expression rules and expression path examples. For a more detailed usage, you can check out this [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp).

Basic expression rules:

| Expression | Description                                                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /          | Selects from the root node                                                                            |
| //         | Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are |
| .          | Selects the parent of the current node                                                                |
| @          | Selects attributes                                                                                    |

Path Expression examples:

| Path Expression     | Results                                                                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /bookstore/book[1]  | Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element.       |
| //book              | Selects all book elements no matter where they are in the document               |
| //@lang             | Selects all attributes that are named lang                                       |
| //title[@lang='en'] | Selects all the title elements that have a "lang" attribute with a value of "en" |
