## Objective

- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`

### matplotlib

#### How to plot multiple chart in one input cell

<!-- TODO: .figure() -->

## Data visualization

**TODO**: examples and counter examples. Where visualization helps and where visualization can go wrong. How data and viz can cheat you.

## GitHub repo

### Presenting dataset

<!-- TODO: requirement on presenting dataset -->

### README.md

"README" is a convention in computer world. You can find a file of this name in almost all software distribution. It means exactly the same as its name indicates: before you do anything, read me first! This file usually gives people instructions on first steps to work with the software. It may point to other more detailed tutorials or mannuals. The `.md` in `README.md` is just a suffix to indicate that this file is written in markdown format. When GitHub sees this file, it renders the file into HTML (for your web browser) using a markdown compiler. You can check out the [README.md](README.md) of this current repo to get an idea.

Besides giving important project information and "play the open source way", a good README file is also an "elevator pitch" to potential readers/ users. You want to present the key functions/ highlights in quick/ direct way. Here are some tips for your consideration.

- Use one sentence to summarise the project. You can use analogy to help visitors quickly comprehend the content.
- Include a "demo" section to show the outcome. Screenshots may help.
- Include a "quickstart" to show user the painless operations that can give some prelminary results.
- Include a "license" section to make the file look professional
- A [tutorial](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/) to use GIFs to better present your work on GitHub.
